Well done on all your work here - you’ve got a working visualisation and a convincing story behind it!

(1) I’m not familiar with basketball, so I can answer this!
The summary was very clear about what a 3-point shot meant, and that the visualisation would be about the idea that these shots had increased over time. There are a couple of errors in tense and probable typos, fixing them would make it easier to read but I understood the meaning!
However, I had trouble completely understanding the four different statistics that relate to 3-point shots. What is the difference between a shot being ‘attempted’ or ‘made’? What exactly is 3P\%: the percentage of shots that are three point shots, the proportion of plays or moves (not sure if this means something in basketball) that are shots at all? Is it the percentage of three point shots that are successful? It’s very hard to tell.

To someone who doesn’t know about basketball, it’s hard to know which of these four plots is most relevant or important to answer the central question. Some guidance or even removing some of these options might help you to present your story clearly to the audience - remember that you are the expert, sharing your finding or story with us and that this should be an explanatory rather than exploratory plot.

Rather than using a key, would it be possible to put the vertical axis label in words directly on the plot? That would facilitate understanding without having to move attention around the page. You could add further explanatory notes below if necessary. In the key you mention about ‘season’ and ‘year’ — are these terms interchangeable or are you referring to different time periods?

I think your remarks and observations at the bottom are really interesting and give some useful background information - don’t hesitate to give these more emphasis to help the viewer read your plot. I recommend that you report the actual median values that you mention in comment 1.

(2) It wasn’t immediately clear to me when I looked at the plot what the dots meant. However, having clicked on a team name, I could guess that the data was aggregated by year and by team.

I think the tooltip on the plot is not very useful - without highlighting the circle, I can’t tell which circle is selected, and they are very much over plotted. You could think about other ways to use tooltips to add to the message.
Take care to style the tooltip correctly - it looks like it’s always got a height to accommodate two rows even when the name of the team fits on a single row.

I didn’t have any technical issues that I noticed - the buttons worked well! However, after clicking on Utah Jazz I had trouble reading the name because the colours are too dark together.

(3) Overall, I think the presentation is quite effective - I think that your choice of plot type and use of transparency is pretty good for showing a change of a distribution over time. 
As someone who doesn’t know about basketball, I wasn’t particularly interested in clicking on specific teams - I didn’t know which ones might be particularly ‘representative’ or interesting. I am OK with getting more detail in this way, but it would be great to have some motivation from you to do so - what should I explore?
Before clicking on those specific teams, the whole plot is grey, which is a little depressing as a colour scheme. Perhaps you could use a colour for the first view of the plot, but then grey out the (other) points when a viewer starts selecting particular teams?

There are a couple of questions that came to my mind when looking at your plot; you might like to think about whether they would be interesting to put more effort into representing them.
What happened to 3PA and 3P in 1999 and 2016? I’m guessing 2016 is because the year is barely started, but what about 1999? It looks very low.
Are there aggregated statistics for the whole NBA? Are they worth considering? It’s fun to look on a team-by-team basis, especially if you’re a fan, but I wondered how strong the pattern is for the whole league.

Well done, your visualisation has an interesting story and a good plot at the centre of it. Improvements you make based on feedback from me and others can really polish it and make it worth reading. Keep up the hard work!
