    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In basketball games, a team earned three points if the a successful shot is made behind the three-point arc,
                which is typically 23 feet from the hoop. If a successful shot is made within the three-point arc,
                the team earned two-points instead.</p>

            <p>In short, the dilemma of the coach and the players are facing is:
        should you take greater risk, make shoot far from the basket that potentially gives you three points?
        or should you shoot the ball near the basket but only get two points? </p>

                <p>This visualization shows several statistical metrics by each NBA team during 1990 to 2016.</p>

        <p>Remarks and obervations</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
               The NBA teams shoots more and more three-pointer. The median of 3PAPG increased almost three times during the span of 1990 to 2016.
            </li>

            <li>
                The small spike of 3PAPG during 1995 and 1997 is due to that the three point line was shortened to 22 feet, but it was restored to its original setting since 1998.
            </li>

            <li>
                Although the three point shots dramatically increase, the shot percentage remains stable.
                This indicates that the most the NBA team are very disciplined in attempting their three-point shots.
