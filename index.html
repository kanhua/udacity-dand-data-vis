    <h2>The evolution of three-point shots in the NBA</h2>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In basketball games, a team earned three points if the a successful shot is made behind the three-point arc,
                which is typically 23 feet from the hoop. If a successful shot is made within the three-point arc,
                the team earned two-points instead.</p>

            <p>In short, the dilemma of the coach and the players are facing is:
        should you take greater risk, make shoot far from the basket that potentially gives you three points?
        or should you shoot the ball near the basket but only get two points? </p>

                <p>This visualization shows several statistical metrics by each NBA team during 1990 to 2016.</p>

            <h4>Explanation of metrics </h4>
    <p>3PAPG: averaged three-point shots attempted per game of a team during a season</p>
    <p>3PA: total three-point shots attemped by a team during the season</p>
    <p>3P: total successful three-point shots of a team during the season</p>
        <p>3P%: shot percentage of a team during a season, i.e., 3P divided by 3PA of each team.</p>
        <h4><p>Remarks and obervations</p></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
               The NBA teams shoots more and more three-pointer.
                The median of 3PAPG increased almost three times during the span of 1990 to 2016.
            </li>

            <li>
                The small spike of 3PAPG during 1995 and 1997 is due to that the three point line was shortened to 22 feet,
                but it was restored to its original setting since 1998.
            </li>

            <li>
                3P and 3PA are particularly low in 1999, 2012 and 2016 because of the following reason: 2016 is an ongoing season.
                In the season of 1999 and 2012, the total play games are reduced because of lockout,
                which is due to the player association fails to make a deal with the league.
                In 1999 season, only 50 games are played, whereas only 66 games were played in 2012 season.

            </li>

            <li>
                Although the three point shots dramatically increase, the shot percentage remains stable.
                This indicates that the most the NBA team are very disciplined in attempting their three-point shots.
