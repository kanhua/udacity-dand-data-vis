            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>In basketball games, a team earned three points if the a successful shot is made behind the three-point
                arc by the player,
                which is typically 23 feet from the basket. If a successful shot is made inside the three-point arc,
                the team earned two-points instead. For every offense opportunity, a team can choose to make a two-point shot or
                three-point shot.</p>
            <h4>Should you take the risk and shoot the three-pointer?</h4>
            In short, the dilemma that the basketball players are facing is:
            should you take greater risk, shoot the ball further from the basket that potentially gives you three
            points?
            or should you shoot the ball near the basket but only get two points?

            <h4>A "crowd wisdom" approach to this problem</h4>
            <p>Answering this question requires a lot of knowledge of basketball game and its related statistics.
                Every professional basketball club has a team to do these analysis and decide the optimal strategy
                based on the capability of their player or what kind of player they should draft.</p>

            <p>We do not have these knowledge or resources. However, we can explore the basketball data that are
                available
                to the public to get some clues of how these professionals think and act.</p>

            <p>This visualization shows several statistical data related to three-point shots by each NBA team during 1990 to 2016.

            <p>Season: A basketball season starts from the October of a year and ends in June of the next year.
                The year of season shown in this visualization is the end year of a season.
                For example, 2000 means the season that starts in the October of 1998 and ends in June of 1999.
                Each team has 82 games in a season.</p>
            <p>3PAPG: averaged three-point shots attempted per game of a team during a season</p>
            <p>3PA: total three-point shots attempted by a team during the season</p>
            <p>3P: total successful three-point shots of a team during the season</p>
            <p>3P%: successful rate of three-point shots of a team during a season, i.e., 3P divided by 3PA of each
                team. This is also known as three-point shot percentage.</p>
            <h4>Remarks</h4>
            <ol>

                <li>
                    The small spike of 3PAPG during 1995 and 1997 is due to that the three point line was shortened to
                    22 feet,
                    but it was restored to its original setting since 1998.
                </li>

                <li>
                    3P and 3PA are particularly low in 1999, 2012 and 2016 because of the following reason:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            1999: A lockout occurs because the the player association fails to make a deal
                            with the team owners before the season start. Only 50 games were played by each team in the
                            season.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2012: Also a lockout season. Only 66 games were played by each team in this season.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2016: A season that is still ongoing.

                        </li>

                    </ol>

                </li>


            </ol>

            <h4>So, is three-pointer worth the risk?</h4>
            The NBA teams shoot more and more three-point shots since 1990. This trends indicate that the NBA teams
            acknowledge that three-point shot is an effective way in getting points,
            despite that no teams monotonically increase their three-point attempts during this span.
            The averaged three-point attempts by each team in 2016 is three times more than that in 1990.
            However, the shot percentage (3P%) remains stable
            during these years. The average is around 35%. This observation has a couple of implications:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A player is willing to take a three-point shot if he thinks that he can shoot around 35% or more. In
                    other words, it has long been recognized by the professional players that a three-point shot is
                    worth the risk if the successful rate around 35%. From the defense point of view, if you are
                    allowing your opponents to shoot three-point shots better than this, then you should fix your
                    defense in order to keep competitive in this league. As a result, the three-point shot percentage
                    reach some kind of "equilibrium" at this level".
                </li>
                <li> The three-point shot attempts increases but the shot percentage (3P%) is relatively stable. This
                    indicates that more players in a team are able to shoot the three-point shots well, whereas the
                    three-point shots were only made by a small number of three-point-shot specialists in the old days.
                </li>
            </ol>
